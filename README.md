# Ibrahim Elmisbah  

Hi there! 👋 I'm Ibrahim, a Sudanese econometrics student, debater, researcher, and ENTP who loves exploring new things. I’m passionate about economic development and evidence-based policymaking, tackling real-world challenges with data.  

## About Me:  
- 📊 **Econometrics Geek**: In my final year of econometrics, where I narrate economic tales with data visualizations.  
- 🔥 **Translator Extraordinaire**: Currently translating *"Building State Capability"* into Arabic. Stay tuned—it’s coming soon!  
- 😉 **Debate Wizard**: I train youth to create the most convincing logical fallacies (yes, you read that right).  
- 🤓 **Philosophy Buff**: Once a philosophy maniac reading hundreds of pages daily, now "just interested." Shoutout to my favorite philosopher, David Hume!  

## Hobbies:  
- 📚 Reading *everything*—the more abstract, the better.  
- 🎨 Drawing on anything—paper, dirt, lemons, Cartesian planes... Here’s my masterpiece: **Descartes in math functions.**
